        <p>Karachi due to its geographical and strategic location is known as the gateway to Asia. Considered as a safe harbor since time <br>
            immemorial, Karachi was a small fishing village in early nineteenth century. Historians identify it with its proximity to a place from <br>
            where a part of Alexander's Army, boarded the Greek Flotilla in 326 B.C. <br>
            <br>
            The first mention of Karachi as a port is found in an Arabic treatise 'Muhit' on navigation relating to the West Coast of India and the <br>
            Persian Gulf. Written in 1558, this treatise warns the sailors of whirlpools and advises them to seek safety in Karachi Harbor if they <br>
            found themselves drifting dangerously. <br>
            <br>
            It is also significant to mention that the first Muslim Conqueror of India, Mohammad Bin Qasim, landed at Daibal, in vicinity <br>
            of Karachi in 711 A.D. Karachi also has the distinction of being the birth place of the founder of Pakistan, Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali <br>
            brJinnah and was the first capital of Pakistan till 1963. It is now the largest city with a bustling and ever increasing population of <br>
            overten million. <br>
            <br>
            By 1852, Karachi was an established city with a population of about 14,000 with a prosperous trade in over-seas markets. However, <br>
            the existing Port started taking shape in 1854, when the projects of dredging the main navigable channel and the construction of a mole <br>
            or causeway joining the main harbor with the rest of the city were undertaken. About 5 years later, construction of Manora <br>
            Breakwater, Keamari Groyne, the Napier Mole Bridge, Native Jetty and the Chinna Creek were started which gave initial shape to the <br>
            port. <br>
            <br>
            The construction of the wharves started in 1882, and by 1914 the East Wharves and the Napier Mole Boat Wharf had been completed. <br>
            During the period between 1927 and 1944, the West Wharves of the Port, the lighterage berths and the ship-repairing berths <br>
            were constructed. Most of these facilities were obsolete by the time Pakistan came into existence in 1947. Since then, the port <br>
            administration has embarked on extensive development of the port on modern lines. <br>
            <br>
            At the time of independence in 1947, the Port capacity was about 1.5 million tons of dry cargo and 1.0 million tons of P.O.L. products <br>
            per annum. Karachi Port is now handling over 11.74 million tons of liquid cargo and 25.45 million tons of dry cargo, including 1,213,744 <br>
            TEUs which constitute about 60% of import/ export of the country. <br>

        <p>The Port Muhammad Bin Qasim, or Qasim Port Authority, also known as Port Qasim, is a deep-water seaport in Karachi, Sindh, <br>
            Pakistan, on the coastline of the Arabian Sea under the administrative control of the Secretary to the Government of Pakistan <br>
            for Maritime Affairs. It is Pakistan's second busiest port, handling about 35% of the nation's cargo (17 million tons per annum). <br>
            Port Qasim and Karachi Port, the busiest port of country, together handle more than 90% of all external trade of Pakistan. <br>
<br>
            The port encompasses a total area of 12,000 acres (49 km2) wherein many industrial zones operate. In addition to the Pakistan <br>
            Steel Mills (PSM) and KESC Bin Qasim Power Plant, around 80% of the Pakistan's automotive industry is located at Port Qasim. <br>
            The port also provides direct waterfront access to two major nearby industrial areas, Export Processing Zone (Landhi) and Korangi <br>
            Industrial Area. Approximately 60% of country's export and import is originated from these areas. Port Qasim is managed by Port Qasim <br>
            Authority, a semi-autonomous government body.</p></div>

        <p>The Gwadar Port or Gwadar Port Authority is the deepest sea port in the world,[citation needed] situated on the Arabian Sea at Gwadar <br>
            in Balochistan province of Pakistan and is under the administrative control of the Maritime Secretary of Pakistan and operational <br>
            control of the China Overseas Port Holding Company. The port features prominently in the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) <br>
            plan, and is considered to be a link between the Belt and Road Initiative and the Maritime Silk Road projects. It is about 120 <br>
            kilometres (75 mi) southwest of Turbat, and 170 kilometres (110 mi) to the east of Chabahar Port (Sistan and Balochistan Province <br>
            in Iran). <br>
<br>
            Gwadar's potential to be a deep water sea port was first noted in 1954, while the city was still under Omani sovereignty. Plans for <br>
            construction of the port were not realised until 2007, when the port was inaugurated by Parvez Musharraf after four years of construction, <br>
             at a cost of $248 million. <br>
            <br>
            In 2015, it was announced that the city and port would be further developed under CPEC at a cost of $1.62 billion, with the aim of linking <br>
            northern Pakistan and western China to the deep water seaport. The port will also be the site of a floating liquefied natural gas facility <br>
            that will be built as part of the larger $2.5 billion Gwadar-Nawabshah segment of the Iran–Pakistan gas pipeline project. Construction <br>
            began in June 2016 on the Gwadar Special Economic Zone, which is being built on 2,292-acre site adjacent to Gwadar's port. In late 2015, <br>
            the port was officially leased to China for 43 years, until 2059. <br>
            <br>
            Gwadar Port became formally operational on 14 November 2016, when it was inaugurated by Pakistan's Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif; <br>
            the first convoy was seen off by the then Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff, General Raheel Sharif. On 14 January 2020, Pakistan operationalized <br>
            Gwadar Port for Afghan transit trade.</p></div>

        <p>Since 2016, South Asia Pakistan Terminal (SAPT) operates the largest deep sea port of the country. Hutchison Ports Pakistan <br>
            invested $600m in the first phase of SAPT which included two berths having length of 800 meters. <br>
<br>
            Hutchison Ports Pakistan is a subsidiary of Hutchison Port Holdings, which in turn is a subsidiary of CK Hutchison Holdings. <br>
            On 18 December 2019, Hutchison Ports Pakistan welcomed CV COSCO BELGIUM, the largest container vessel to ever call at any port <br>
            of Pakistan, with a length of over 366 meters and a capacity of 13,386 TEUs.[25].</p></div>
