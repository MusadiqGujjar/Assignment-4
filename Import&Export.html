        Pakistan has bilateral and multilateral trade agreements with many nations and international organizations. It is a member of the <br>
        World Trade Organization, part of the South Asian Free Trade Area agreement and the China–Pakistan Free Trade Agreement. <br>
        Fluctuating world demand for its exports, domestic political uncertainty, and the impact of occasional droughts on its agricultural <br>
        production have all contributed to variability in Pakistan's trade deficit. The trade deficit for the fiscal year 2013/14 is $7.743 billion, <br>
        exports are $10.367 billion in July–November 2013 and imports are $18.110 billion 
        <br>
        <br>
        Pakistan's exports continue to be dominated by men power export in the subcontinent,cotton textiles and apparel. Imports include <br>
        petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, fertilizer, capital goods, industrial raw materials, and consumer products.
        <br>
        <br>
        On 12 December 2013, the European Union granted GSP Plus status to Pakistan until 2017, which enabled it to export 20% of its good <br>
        with 0 tariff and 70 percent at preferential rates to the EU market. This status was given after the European Parliament passed the <br>
        resolution by 406-186 votes.</p>

            2007, Pakistan started exporting cement to India to fill in the shortage there caused by the building boom. Russia is a growing <br>
            market for Pakistani exporters. In 2009/2010 the export target of Pakistan was US$20 billion.[8] As of April 2015, Pakistan's exports <br>
